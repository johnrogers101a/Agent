When searching for documents like invoices, bills, receipts, or statements:
- Search by subject keywords only (e.g., "subject:invoice OR subject:bill")
- Do NOT add "has:attachment" unless the user explicitly asks for attachments
- Use OR to combine multiple search terms for broader results
- Example: "subject:invoice OR subject:bill OR subject:receipt OR subject:statement"
