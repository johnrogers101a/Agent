Gets the full contents of a specific email by its Gmail message ID.

The messageId parameter must be the Gmail message ID returned by GetMail or SearchMail (e.g., "196e4a3b2c1d0e5f"). This is NOT an order number, confirmation number, or any other ID found within the email content itself.

Returns the complete email body, headers, and any attachment metadata.
